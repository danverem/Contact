# Contact
A simple Contact Manager with PHP OOP using the MVC Design pattern

The project is simaple and does not intend to use any framework.
Instead, I build a simple front controller to serve my pages
and action controllers that communicate with the models.


#Template
The PHP Smarty Templating Engine.
